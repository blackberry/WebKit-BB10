<!--
    The following proof applies to the first case (#solid-solid) where both the backdrop and the
    source are solid.

    In this test the following combinations are also tested:
        Backdrop with 0.5 alpha blended with solid source
        Solid backdrop blended with source with 0.5 alpha
        Backdrop with 0.5 alpha blended with source with 0.5 alpha
    The underlying proof of the above mentioned cases is the same: the colors are premultiplied
    and then blended together.

    The final color of #solid-solid depends on the "saturation" blend mode, which is a non-separable
    blend mode. This means that colors are blended together as a whole, not component by component.

    The formula for this blend mode is:
        Cr = B(Cb, Cs) = SetLum(SetSat(Cb, Sat(Cs)), Lum(Cb))

    With:
        Cr: the resulting color
        Cb: the backdrop color, which is #solid-solid ("original DOM element color")
        Cs: the source color, which is mix_color
        Sat(Cb): the saturation of Cb. Saturation for color C is generally defined by
           Sat(C): max(Cred, Cgreen, Cblue) - min(Cred, Cgreen, Cblue)
        Lum(Cs): the luminosity of Cs. Luminosity for color C is generally defined by
           Lum(C): 0.3 * Cred + 0.59 * Cgreen + 0.11 * Cblue
        SetSat(Cb, Sat(Cs)): the function that sets the saturation
        SetLum(SetSat(Cb, Sat(Cs)), Lum(Cb)): the function that sets the luminosity.

    The function that sets the luminosity l on the color C is generally defined by:

        SetLum(C, l)
            d = l - Lum(C)
            Cred = Cred + d
            Cgreen = Cgreen + d
            Cblue = Cblue + d
            return ClipColor(C)

    At this point the color C has to be clipped between [0..1]  by the ClipColor function, which is
    generally defined by:

        ClipColor(C)
            l = Lum(C)
            n = min(Cred, Cgreen, Cblue)
            x = max(Cred, Cgreen, Cblue)
            if n < 0.0
                Cred = l + (((Cred - l) * l) / (l - n))
                Cgreen = l + (((Cgreen - l) * l) / (l - n))
                Cblue = l + (((Cblue - l) * l) / (l - n))
            if x > 1.0
                Cred = l + (((Cred - l) * (1 - l)) / (x - l))
                Cgreen = l + (((Cgreen - l) * (1 - l)) / (x - l))
                Cblue = l + (((Cblue - l) * (1 - l)) / (x - l))
            return C

    The function that sets the saturation s on the color C is generally defined by:

        SetSat(C, s)
            if(Cmax > Cmin)
                Cmid = (((Cmid - Cmin) * s) / (Cmax - Cmin))
                Cmax = s
            else
                Cmid = Cmax = 0
            Cmin = 0
            return C

    In this test case:
        Lum(Cb) = 0.3 * 0.9 + 0.59 * 0.5 + 0.11 * 0.3
        Lum(Cb) = 0.27 + 0.295 + 0.033
        Lum(Cb) = 0.598

        Sat(Cs) = max(0.1, 0.2, 0.4) - min(0.1, 0.2, 0.4)
        Sat(Cs) = 0.4 - 0.1
        Sat(Cs) = 0.3

        For the sake of brevity the result of this computation is called Ct
        Ct = SetSat(Cb, Sat(Cs))
            0.9 > 0.3
                Cmid = (((0.5 - 0.3) * 0.3) / (0.9 - 0.3) = 0.2 * 0.3 / 0.6 = 0.06 / 0.6 = 0.10
                Cmax = 0.3
            Cmin = 0
            return (0.3, 0.10, 0.0)

    Cr = SetLum(Ct, 0.598)
        d = 0.598 - (0.3 * 0.3 + 0.59 * 0.10 + 0.11 * 0.0) = 0.598 - (0.09 + 0.059) = 0.598 - 0.149
        d = 0.449
        Cred = 0.3 + 0.449 = 0.749
        Cgreen = 0.10 + 0.449 = 0.549
        Cblue = 0.0 + 0.449 = 0.449
        return (0.749, 0.549, 0.449)

    This value is equivalent to (191, 140, 115), which is the expected color.
    This is the exact color value, other ports might experience slight differences.
