FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
This test ensures that multiple form submission protection is correctly reset on mouse events. To test manually:

Click on "Click 1" to submit form to a new window. The window will close immediately.
Click on "Click 2" to submit form to this window. Single word "SUCCESS" should replace the contents of this document.
If either event doesn't occur, the test has failed.
