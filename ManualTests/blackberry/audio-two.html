<p>This page exists to test the interaction between multiple audio players.

Beach:
<audio src="./resources/beach.wav" controls loop width="100" height="50">
Your browser doesn't support the <code>Audio</code> element</audio>

<li>Start the first media player.
Verify that you can pause and resume it multiple times. Note that the first media is short so it is set to loop. Use the volume slider and confirm that media volume stays in synch with global device volume.
</li>
<li>Start the second player while the first is still playing.
Verify that the second player starts and the first continues playing. The result should sound like a choir singing at the beach. Verify that each media player can now set its volume independently, no longer synchronized to device volume.
<li>Without stopping either player, touch on the following link which will automatically open in a new tab: <a href="./resources/game.html" target="_blank">Sample HTML5 Game Sounds</a>.
Verify that the first sound the game produces pauses BOTH players on the previous tab.
</li>
<li>You should be hearing quiet background music, with a repetitive tapping sound in the foreground about every 1000ms.
Verify that the background music continues to play while the tapping sound effects are heard. Also verify that the background music is significantly quieter than the tapping.
</li>
<li>Go back to the first tab. Resume play of one of the media players.
Verify that BOTH media players resume play, and that all game sounds stop.
</li>
<li>Now press the h/w play/pause button on the device, or the pause button in the system tray's media bubble.
Verify that BOTH media players pause, and that the game sounds from the other tab resume, including the game background music. The game sounds resume because the Javascript game code is still actively trying to play tapping sounds.
</li>
<li>Open the system tray's media bubble, a.k.a the Now Playing service.
Verify that information for the longest media is shown in the media bubble, uninterupted by shorter media or sound effects. For the HTML5 game sounds the longest media is the background music by The Tragically Hip. For the music page the longest media is the choir track.
