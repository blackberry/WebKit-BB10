<p>This test can be used to verify that we can navigate back in history from a web page that specifies the viewport minimum-scale property.</p>
<p>Assuming you did not zoom-in or zoom-out of this page after it was initially loaded and that this page was loaded from the Start Page screen, press the escape button on the phone to navigate back. If you navigate back to the Start Page, then this test PASSED. Otherwise, it FAILED.</p>
