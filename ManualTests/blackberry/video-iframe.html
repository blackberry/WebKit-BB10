<p>Lots of vertical whitespace here, enough to make the page scroll:

</p>
    <p>The following content is contained within an &lt;iframe&gt;.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Verify that content (including video media players) is clipped by the border of the &lt;iframe&gt; which contains it.</li>
    <li>Verify that video media players are also still clipped properly if/when you scroll the contents of the &lt;iframe&gt;.</li>
    <li>Repeat the above tests (i.e. verify that clipping still works) when the screen is pinch-zoomed, and when the outermost document layer is scrolled.</li>
    <li>Repeat the above tests (i.e. verify that clipping still works) when a video media player is actually playing a video.</li>
    </ul>
