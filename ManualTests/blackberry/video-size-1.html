<h1>Sized Video #1</h1>
<p>This is a video element which has no explicit height and width attributes.
The intrinsic size of the media file is smaller (320x240).</p>
<p>When you start the video, verify that the size of the media player
increases from its default 300x150 to the video's intrinsic size of 320x240.</p>
<p>Also verify that the controls on the control bar look correctly placed
before and after the video is played, and that the scrolling thumb-bar reaches
its right-hand end just as the 'time remaining' reaches "00:00", and
the video comes to an end.
