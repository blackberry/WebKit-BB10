<h1>Sized Video #3</h1>
<p>This is a video element with explicit width=400 and height=150 attributes.
The intrinsic size of the media file is smaller (320x240).</p>
<p>The aspect ratio of the video element and of the video are different:
the window is short and wide compared to the video.</p>
<p>When you start the video, verify that the height of the video is reduced
to match the height of the containing rectangle, and that the width of the video
is reduced in proportion (to keep the right aspect ratio) to less than
the width of the video element.</p>
