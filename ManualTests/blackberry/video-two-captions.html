<h1>Two Captions</h1>
<p>Use this to test switching between two videos, one which includes a caption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the play to start one video</li>
<li>Without stopping the first video, start the second video (the first video should stop automatically)</li>
<li>Without stopping the second video, start the first video (the second video should stop automatically)</li>
<li>Try the above repeatedly: verify that the caption window is displayed
whenever the first video is playing, and verify that there is no browser crash.</li>
</ul>
